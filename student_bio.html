      <p> Hello! My name is Lidia Perzyna and I am 19 years old. I am a third year college student
          at the University of San Francisco. I am pursuing a Computer Science 
          degree with a minor in Design. I am comfortable coding in Java, Python,
           and C. I am currently learning CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
          <br> <br>
          My coding experience began in High School, where I took AP Computer Science
           Principles. After taking that class, I found a love for coding and creating
          and discovered that I am able to understand code and coding languages pretty
          quickly. From there, I applied to my university as a Computer Science major
          and have stuck to it ever since. I am excited to continue learning and to 
          work with in the field.
