# Main
This page is dedicated to showing my projects, bio, and information. It includes a header that includes the following sections: home, about me, my work, and contact me. When clicked, the UI scrolls to the section. There is a picture included alone with an aesthetic background image. The About Me section includes a concise, informative paragraph about myself and my coding experience. The projects section includes three in-the-works projects that will be updated with actual projects later on. The projects are able to be highlighted when hovered over and the user is taken to the project when they click on the project title. The Contact Me section includes my email, linkedin, and Github links. When clicked, the user is taken to those forms of information. Last, there is a footer that thanks the user for visiting.
